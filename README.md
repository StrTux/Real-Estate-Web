# Real-Estate-Web
Real-Estate-Web is a modern, user-friendly platform for property listings, featuring intuitive design, advanced search, and responsive layout for seamless browsing.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Clone the project repository using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/itsmeashish07/Real-Estate-Web.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd Real-Estate-Web
Step 2: Install Node.js and npm
Before proceeding, ensure that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your machine.

You can download and install Node.js from the official website.
npm is included with Node.js, so installing Node.js will also install npm.
To check if Node.js and npm are installed, run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
This will show you the installed versions of Node.js and npm.

Step 3: Install Dependencies
Once you are in the project directory, install all the required dependencies using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This command reads the package.json file and installs all the dependencies listed under dependencies and devDependencies.

Step 4: Run the Project
To start the project and run it on localhost, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This command typically starts the development server and makes the project accessible at http://localhost:3000 or another specified port.

Step 5: Open the Project in Your Browser
Open your web browser.
Go to http://localhost:5173 (or the port number provided in the terminal).
You should see the project running locally on your machine.

Additional Tips
Modifying the Port: If you need to run the project on a different port, you can usually modify the port number in the project's configuration files or use an environment variable.
Stopping the Server: To stop the development server, go back to your terminal and press Ctrl + C.
Troubleshooting: If you encounter any errors, make sure all dependencies are installed correctly and that you are using the correct version of Node.js and npm.
